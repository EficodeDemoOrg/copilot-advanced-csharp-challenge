# FlightDelay Workshop Starter Scaffold

This is a minimal ASP.NET Core Web API starter project for the FlightDelay workshop. It includes:

- `FlightDelay.Api`: A basic Web API project with minimal APIs and Swagger.
- `FlightDelay.Tests`: An xUnit test project referencing the API.

To use:
1. Copy this folder to your workspace.
2. Open `FlightDelayWorkshop.sln` in Visual Studio or VS Code.
3. Run `dotnet build` to ensure it compiles.
4. Run `dotnet test` to run the tests.
5. Start extending with the workshop tasks.

This scaffold is for quick setup; advanced users can start from scratch.
